## Themes Folder

On large sites and applications, it is not unusual to have different themes. There are certainly different ways of dealing with it and its ideal of having them all in a `themes/` folder.

- `_theme.scss`
- `_admin.scss`

## Note

This is very project-specific and is likely to be non-existent on many projects.
